## About
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). 
This is what the End Application would look like.

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which gets populated at startup with data. To have persistent data, I have used MySql database. Refer the docker-compose and Dockerfile to setup your Frontend Application and Link it with MySql Database.
